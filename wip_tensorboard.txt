Yes, you can easily generate graphs of your loss. The Hugging Face `Trainer` has built-in support for a powerful visualization tool called **TensorBoard**.

Based on your script, you have a `logging_dir` set up, but the line to activate TensorBoard reporting is commented out.

### \#\# ‚öôÔ∏è How to Enable Loss Graphing

You just need to make two small changes:

#### 1\. Install TensorBoard

If you don't already have it, install the `tensorboard` package in your Python environment.

```bash
pip install tensorboard
```

#### 2\. Modify Your `TrainingArguments`

In your `train.py` script, find your `TrainingArguments` and uncomment the `report_to` line.

```python
# train.py

# ... inside your run_training() function

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    # ... your other arguments
    logging_dir=f"training-logs/{model_name}", # You already have this, which is great
    report_to=["tensorboard"],               # <-- UNCOMMENT THIS LINE
    # ...
)
```

### \#\# üöÄ How to View the Graph

After making the change, follow these steps:

#### 1\. Rerun Your Training

Start your training again using the `accelerate launch` command. The `Trainer` will now automatically create special log files in your `training-logs/Modern/4.6` directory that TensorBoard can read.

#### 2\. Launch the TensorBoard Dashboard

While your training is running (or after it has finished), open a **new terminal** on your cluster and run the following command:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir training-logs/Modern/4.6
```

This starts a web server. It will print a URL, usually `http://localhost:6006/`.

#### 3\. View the Graph in Your Browser (with SSH Tunneling)

Since the server is running on the remote cluster node, you can't open `localhost:6006` directly. You need to create an SSH tunnel to forward that port to your local computer.

On your **local machine's terminal** (not the cluster one), run this command:

```bash
ssh -L 6006:localhost:6006 your_username@cluster_address
```

*(Replace `your_username@cluster_address` with your actual login details. Keep this terminal window open.)*

Now, open your web browser on your local computer and go to:
**http://localhost:6006/**

You will see the TensorBoard dashboard, where you can view interactive graphs of your training loss, learning rate, and other metrics over time.
